### Design. Engineering. Product.  

I build products where design, craft, and intelligence meet.  

I’m a product leader who still loves to make things. Most of my work sits at the intersection of WordPress, developer tools, and AI — exploring how thoughtful design can make powerful technology feel simple, fast, and human.  

For over a decade, I’ve helped shape WordPress at scale — including leading design for multiple major WordPress releases, working deeply on Gutenberg, and shipping product at GoDaddy and Automattic.
